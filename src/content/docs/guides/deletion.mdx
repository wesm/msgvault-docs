description: Staging messages for deletion, reviewing manifests, and executing deletes.

## Overview

msgvault supports a staged deletion workflow: select messages, review what will be deleted, then execute against Gmail.

## Staging in the TUI

1. Launch the TUI: `msgvault tui`
2. Navigate to messages you want to delete
3. Press `Space` to toggle individual messages
4. Press `d` to stage selected messages for deletion
5. Press `D` to stage all messages matching the current filter

## Selection Keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` | Toggle selection on current row |
| `A` | Select all visible rows |
| `x` | Clear selection |
| `d` | Stage selected for deletion |
| `D` | Stage all matching current filter |

## Deletion Manifests

Staged deletions create manifests that record exactly which messages will be affected. Review these before executing.

## Execution

Deletions can be executed as:

- **Trash**: Moves messages to Gmail's Trash (recoverable for 30 days)
- **Permanent delete**: Permanently removes messages from Gmail

:::danger
Permanent deletion cannot be undone. Always verify your archive is complete before permanent deletion. Use `msgvault verify` to check integrity.
:::

## Safety Notes

- Sync operations are always read-only
- Deletion requires explicit staging and execution as separate steps
- Manifests provide an audit trail of what was deleted
- Use trash mode first to verify before permanent deletion
