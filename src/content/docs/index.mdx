## How It Works

```
Gmail API  →  sync-full / sync-incremental  →  SQLite (system of record)
                                                    ↓
                                              Parquet cache (analytics)
                                                    ↓
                                              Interactive TUI / Search
```

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesm/msgvault.git
cd msgvault && make install
```

Then [set up OAuth credentials](/guides/oauth-setup/) and [start syncing](/quickstart/).
