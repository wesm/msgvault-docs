import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Currently supports Gmail, with IMAP support and MBOX import coming soon. WhatsApp and other messaging platforms are also planned.

Read the [Introduction](/introduction/) to learn more about why this project was created.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://msgvault.io/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://msgvault.io/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then [set up OAuth credentials](/guides/oauth-setup/) and [start syncing](/setup/). You can also [build from source](/setup/#build-from-source).

## Why msgvault?

Your email and other message data is yours. msgvault downloads a complete local copy of your Gmail (every message, every attachment, every label) then everything runs offline against that archive. Search, analytics, the TUI, and the MCP server all query local SQLite and Parquet files. **Nothing touches the Gmail API outside of sync and deletion commands that you run explicitly.** No background OAuth sessions, no persistent API connections, no risk of an AI assistant or a compromised token silently accessing your live mailbox.

Years of PDFs, photos, documents, and spreadsheets buried in your inbox become ordinary files on your filesystem, deduplicated and instantly searchable. Your data is no longer locked behind a web interface or an API. It's just files on disk that you own and control.

## Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Full Gmail Backup" icon="document">
    Downloads complete messages including raw MIME, labels, metadata, and every attachment. Every PDF, photo, spreadsheet, and document you've ever received or sent is extracted and stored locally, deduplicated by content hash. Once synced, everything works offline.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lightning-Fast TUI" icon="laptop">
    Explore hundreds of thousands of messages with instant aggregation and drill-down. Powered by DuckDB over Parquet, hundreds of times faster than SQL JOINs, in a small footprint.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full-Text Search" icon="magnifier">
    SQLite FTS5-powered search with Gmail-like query syntax. Search by sender, date, label, size, attachments, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Account" icon="add-document">
    Archive multiple Gmail accounts in a single database with cross-account search.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incremental Sync" icon="rocket">
    Uses Gmail History API for efficient updates after initial full sync. Resumable checkpoints for interrupted syncs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Server" icon="puzzle">
    Expose your archive to AI assistants like Claude Desktop via the Model Context Protocol. Search, read, and analyze your messages from any MCP-compatible LLM.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safe Deletion" icon="warning">
    Stage messages for deletion in the TUI, review manifests, then permanently delete from Gmail.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
