## Performance

The TUI is built on DuckDB querying Parquet metadata exports, not the raw SQLite database. This architecture delivers aggregate queries (top senders, domains, labels, time series) **hundreds of times faster** than equivalent SQLite JOINs. The Parquet analytics layer has a small footprint, so drill-down and re-aggregation feel instant even on very large archives.

See [Parquet Analytics](/guides/parquet/) for details on the cache format and how to rebuild it.

## Launch

```bash
# Launch the TUI
msgvault tui

# Filter by account
msgvault tui --account you@gmail.com
```

The TUI automatically builds or updates the Parquet analytics cache on launch when new messages are detected.

## View Modes

The TUI provides five aggregate view modes. Press `g` to cycle through them:

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| Senders | Aggregate by sender email address |
| Recipients | Aggregate by recipient |
| Domains | Aggregate by sender domain |
| Labels | Aggregate by Gmail label |
| Time | Aggregate by time period (year/month/day) |

## Navigation

Press `Enter` to drill down into any row (e.g., click a sender to see their messages). Press `Esc` or `Backspace` to go back.
