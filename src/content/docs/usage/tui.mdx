## Performance

The TUI is built on DuckDB querying Parquet metadata exports, not the raw SQLite database. This architecture delivers aggregate queries (top senders, domains, labels, time series) **hundreds of times faster** than equivalent SQLite JOINs. The Parquet analytics layer has a small footprint, so drill-down and re-aggregation feel instant even on very large archives.

See [Data Storage](/architecture/storage/) for details on the cache format and how to rebuild it.

## Launch

```bash
# Launch the TUI
msgvault tui

# Filter by account
msgvault tui --account you@gmail.com
```

The TUI automatically builds or updates the Parquet analytics cache on launch when new messages are detected.

## View Modes

The TUI provides five aggregate view modes. Press `g` to cycle through them:

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| Senders | Aggregate by sender email address |
| Recipients | Aggregate by recipient |
| Domains | Aggregate by sender domain |
| Labels | Aggregate by Gmail label |
| Time | Aggregate by time period (year/month/day) |

### Time View

The Time view aggregates messages by time period. Press `t` to cycle between monthly, daily, and yearly granularity:

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; gap: 0.5rem;">
  <figure style="margin: 0; text-align: center;" data-lightbox>
    <img src="/tui-time-monthly.svg" alt="Time view: monthly granularity" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;" />
    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">Monthly</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure style="margin: 0; text-align: center;" data-lightbox>
    <img src="/tui-time-daily.svg" alt="Time view: daily granularity" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;" />
    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">Daily</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure style="margin: 0; text-align: center;" data-lightbox>
    <img src="/tui-time-yearly.svg" alt="Time view: yearly granularity" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;" />
    <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 0.3rem;">Yearly</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## Navigation

Press `Enter` to drill down into any row (e.g., click a sender to see their messages). Press `Esc` or `Backspace` to go back.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` or `↑` / `↓` | Navigate rows |
| `Enter` | Drill down into selection |
| `Esc` / `Backspace` | Go back |
| `g` | Cycle view mode |
| `s` | Cycle sort field (Name / Count / Size) |
| `r` | Reverse sort direction |
| `t` | Cycle time granularity (Year / Month / Day) |
| `a` | Filter by account |
| `f` | Filter by attachments |
| `Space` | Toggle selection |
| `A` | Select all visible |
| `x` | Clear selection |
| `d` | Stage selected for deletion |
| `D` | Stage all matching current filter |
| `/` | Search |
| `?` | Help |

## Deletion Staging

You can stage messages for deletion directly from the TUI. Select individual rows with `Space`, then press `d` to stage them. To stage an entire group (all messages from a sender, all messages with a label, etc.), press `D` from any aggregate view.

A confirmation dialog shows exactly how many messages will be staged before anything happens. Messages are not deleted immediately; they are placed in a deletion batch that you review and execute separately with `msgvault delete-staged`.
