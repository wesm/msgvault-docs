title: MCP Server
description: Expose your email archive to AI assistants via MCP.
---

The MCP server operates on your **local, read-only archive**, not your live Gmail account. The AI cannot send emails, modify labels, delete messages, or access your Google credentials. You control when data enters the archive (via `sync-full` / `sync`) and when anything is deleted (via the explicit [deletion workflow](/usage/deletion/)). Compared to giving an AI assistant direct OAuth access to your mailbox, this is a fundamentally smaller attack surface.

## Setup

The `mcp` command starts a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server that exposes your email archive as a set of tools. This lets AI assistants like Claude Desktop search, read, and analyze your messages directly.

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the following to your Claude Desktop config file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "msgvault": {
      "command": "msgvault",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

If `msgvault` is not on your PATH, use the full path to the binary. Restart Claude Desktop after saving the config.

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes the following tools to connected AI clients:

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `search_messages` | Full-text search with Gmail-like query syntax | `query` (string), `max_results` (int, optional) |
| `get_message` | Retrieve a single message by ID | `message_id` (int) |
| `list_messages` | List messages with filters | `from` (string), `to` (string), `label` (string), `before` (date), `after` (date), `limit` (int) |
| `get_attachment` | Retrieve an attachment by message ID and filename | `message_id` (int), `filename` (string) |
| `get_stats` | Archive statistics | — |
| `aggregate` | Run aggregate queries (top senders, domains, labels, time series) | `group_by` (string), `limit` (int), `account` (string, optional) |

## Example Usage with Claude

Once configured, you can ask Claude questions like:

- *"Search my email for messages from alice@example.com about the project proposal"*
- *"How many emails did I receive last month?"*
- *"Show me the top 10 senders in my archive"*
- *"Find all messages with attachments larger than 5MB"*

Claude will automatically call the appropriate msgvault tools to retrieve and analyze your messages.

## CLI Flags

```bash
# Start the MCP server (stdio transport)
msgvault mcp

# Force SQL retrieval for all searches
msgvault mcp --force-sql
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--force-sql` | `false` | Always use SQL retrieval instead of FTS5 |
