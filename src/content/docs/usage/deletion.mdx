## Overview

msgvault supports a staged deletion workflow: select messages in the TUI, review what will be deleted, then execute against Gmail. **Deletion only removes messages from Gmail's servers. Your local archive is never modified.** This means you can always search, browse, and export deleted messages from your local copy.

## Bulk Deletion via Aggregate Groups

The fastest way to clean up your inbox is through the TUI's aggregate views. Navigate to the Senders, Domains, or Labels view, find the group you want to remove (e.g., a prolific spam sender or an unwanted mailing list), and press `D` to stage every message in that group for deletion at once.

A confirmation dialog shows exactly how many messages will be staged. Nothing is deleted until you explicitly run `msgvault delete-staged`.

## Selective Deletion

For finer control, drill into any group and use `Space` to select individual rows, then press `d` to stage only the selected messages.

## Staging Steps

1. Launch the TUI: `msgvault tui`
2. Navigate to the view and group you want to clean up
3. Press `D` to stage all messages in the current group, or use `Space` to select individual rows and press `d`
4. Review the confirmation dialog and confirm

## Selection Keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` | Toggle selection on current row |
| `A` | Select all visible rows |
| `x` | Clear selection |
| `d` | Stage selected for deletion |
| `D` | Stage all matching current filter |

## Reviewing and Executing

Staged deletions create manifests that record exactly which messages will be affected. Review before executing:

```bash
# List pending deletion batches
msgvault delete-staged --list

# Execute deletion (trash mode, recoverable for 30 days)
msgvault delete-staged --account you@gmail.com

# Execute permanent deletion
msgvault delete-staged --account you@gmail.com --permanent
```

:::danger
Permanent deletion cannot be undone on Gmail's servers. Always verify your local archive is complete before permanent deletion. Use `msgvault verify` to check integrity. Your local copy is always preserved regardless of what you delete from Gmail.
:::

## Safety Notes

- Sync operations are always read-only
- Deletion only affects Gmail's servers, never your local archive
- Deletion requires explicit staging and execution as separate steps
- Manifests provide an audit trail of what was deleted
- Use trash mode first to verify before permanent deletion
