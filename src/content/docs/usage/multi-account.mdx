## Adding Accounts

Each Gmail account needs its own OAuth authorization:

```bash
msgvault add-account personal@gmail.com
msgvault add-account work@company.com
```

All accounts share the same SQLite database and attachment storage.

## Syncing

Sync all accounts at once by omitting the email argument:

```bash
# Full sync all accounts
msgvault sync-full

# Incremental sync all accounts
msgvault sync
```

Or sync a specific account:

```bash
msgvault sync-full personal@gmail.com
msgvault sync work@company.com
```

## Cross-Account Search

Search queries run across all accounts by default:

```bash
msgvault search "quarterly report"
```

## TUI Filtering

Filter the TUI to a specific account:

```bash
msgvault tui --account work@company.com
```

Or press `a` in the TUI to cycle through account filters interactively.
