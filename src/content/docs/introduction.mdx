I have been living in my e-mail inbox for more than 30 years since the
beginning of the internet in the mid-1990s. 

I became a GMail user in 2006, 20 years ago. During that time, GMail
has become increasingly, to quote Cory Doctorow, *enshittified*. But
my whole life is there, locked up inside Google's walled garden. I
built msgvault so that I could break free from this cage and have
control of my life's messaging data and build advanced tools and
systems to do useful things with it.

This means:

* Search it instantaneously and categorize it the way I want. With a
  beautiful fast terminal UI rather than a slow, increasingly less
  useful web application.
* Chat with it securely via MCP in Claude Desktop and using my home
  local LLM inference servers.
* Extract and file away the over 100,000 e-mail attachments sent to me
  over the years.

I started with GMail but I want all my life's messages in this system,
including WhatsApp, iMessage, and Google Voice. 

I suspect I am not the only one who has felt this way. **I hope you
will join me in this revolution to liberate our life's messages from
their enshittified digital prisons.**
