## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Go | 1.21+ | [golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl/) |
| GCC or Clang | any | Required for CGO (SQLite FTS5 support) |

CGO is required because msgvault uses `mattn/go-sqlite3` which compiles SQLite as a C extension for full-text search (FTS5).

## Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesm/msgvault.git
cd msgvault
```

### Debug Build

```bash
make build
```

Produces `./msgvault` in the project root.

### Release Build

```bash
make build-release
```

Optimized binary with stripped debug symbols.

### Install

```bash
make install
```

Installs to `~/.local/bin` or `$GOPATH/bin`.

## Verify

```bash
msgvault --help
```

You should see the list of available commands. Next, [configure OAuth credentials](/guides/oauth-setup/).
