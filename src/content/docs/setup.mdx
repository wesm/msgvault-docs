## Install Release

```bash
curl -fsSL https://msgvault.io/install.sh | bash
```

The installer detects your OS and architecture, downloads the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wesm/msgvault/releases), verifies the SHA-256 checksum, and installs the binary.

:::note
Windows installer script coming soon. In the meantime, download Windows packages directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wesm/msgvault/releases).
:::

Verify the installation:

```bash
msgvault --help
```

## Build From Source

Requires Go 1.25+ and a C/C++ compiler (GCC or Clang). CGO is required because msgvault uses `mattn/go-sqlite3` (SQLite with FTS5) and `go-duckdb` (Parquet analytics), both of which compile native extensions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesm/msgvault.git
cd msgvault
make install
```

Installs to `~/.local/bin` or `$GOPATH/bin`. For a debug build use `make build`, or `make build-release` for an optimized binary with stripped debug symbols.

Verify the installation:

```bash
msgvault --help
```

## Configure OAuth

Create a Google Cloud project, enable the Gmail API, and download your `client_secret.json`. See the full [OAuth Setup Guide](/guides/oauth-setup/).

Create `~/.msgvault/config.toml`:

```toml
[oauth]
client_secrets = "/path/to/client_secret.json"
```

## Add Your Account

```bash
msgvault add-account you@gmail.com
```

This opens your browser for OAuth consent. For headless servers, use `--headless` for the [device authorization flow](/guides/oauth-setup/#headless-server-setup).

## Sync Email

```bash
# Test with a small batch first
msgvault sync-full you@gmail.com --limit 100

# Or sync a specific date range
msgvault sync-full you@gmail.com --after 2024-01-01 --before 2024-02-01
```

## Explore

```bash
# Search your archive
msgvault search from:alice@example.com

# Launch the interactive TUI
msgvault tui

# View stats
msgvault stats
```
