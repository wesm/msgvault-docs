## Install Release

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://msgvault.io/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://msgvault.io/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer detects your OS and architecture, downloads the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wesm/msgvault/releases), verifies the SHA-256 checksum, and installs the binary.

Verify the installation:

```bash
msgvault --help
```

## Build From Source

Requires Go 1.25+ and a C/C++ compiler (GCC or Clang). CGO is required because msgvault uses `mattn/go-sqlite3` (SQLite with FTS5) and `go-duckdb` (Parquet analytics), both of which compile native extensions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesm/msgvault.git
cd msgvault
make install
```

Installs to `~/.local/bin` or `$GOPATH/bin`. For a debug build use `make build`, or `make build-release` for an optimized binary with stripped debug symbols.

Verify the installation:

```bash
msgvault --help
```

## Configure OAuth

Create a Google Cloud project, enable the Gmail API, and download your `client_secret.json`. See the full [OAuth Setup Guide](/guides/oauth-setup/).

### Where to put config.toml

msgvault stores all data (config, database, tokens, attachments) in a single directory. The default location depends on your platform:

| Platform | Data directory | Config file |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS / Linux** | `~/.msgvault/` | `~/.msgvault/config.toml` |
| **Windows** | `C:\Users\<you>\.msgvault\` | `C:\Users\<you>\.msgvault\config.toml` |

:::tip
The `.msgvault` directory is created automatically the first time you run any msgvault command. If you're unsure of the exact path, run `msgvault add-account you@gmail.com`; the error message may show you where to create the config file.
:::

To store data on a different drive or location, use the `--home` flag or set the `MSGVAULT_HOME` environment variable. If `MSGVAULT_HOME` is set, paths in the table above are relative to that directory instead:

**Per-command (any platform):**
```bash
msgvault sync --home E:/msgvault
```

**Windows (PowerShell, persistent):**
```powershell
$env:MSGVAULT_HOME = "E:\msgvault"
# Or set it permanently:
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("MSGVAULT_HOME", "E:\msgvault", "User")
```

**macOS / Linux (persistent):**
```bash
export MSGVAULT_HOME=/mnt/data/msgvault
```

The `--home` flag takes priority over `MSGVAULT_HOME`. See [Configuration](/configuration/) for all options.

### Create the config file

**macOS / Linux:**
```toml
[oauth]
client_secrets = "/path/to/client_secret.json"
```

**Windows** — use forward slashes in the path:
```toml
[oauth]
client_secrets = "C:/Users/you/Downloads/client_secret.json"
```

## Add Your Account

```bash
msgvault add-account you@gmail.com
```

This opens your browser for OAuth consent. For headless servers, see the [copy-token workflow](/guides/oauth-setup/#headless-server-setup).

## Sync Email

```bash
# Test with a small batch first
msgvault sync-full you@gmail.com --limit 100

# Or sync a specific date range
msgvault sync-full you@gmail.com --after 2024-01-01 --before 2024-02-01

# Sync everything (no limit)
msgvault sync-full you@gmail.com
```

### What to Expect

The initial full sync downloads every message and attachment from Gmail, so it can take a while. In testing we have observed roughly 50 messages per second on fast internet, but the Gmail API has per-user quotas that may throttle throughput further. An account with hundreds of thousands of messages and large attachments may take several hours; an account with millions of messages could take significantly longer. We recommend starting with `--limit` or a date range to verify everything works before kicking off the full run.

The good news: syncs are resumable (see below), and once the initial sync is complete, incremental syncs only fetch new and changed messages, which is much faster.

### Full Sync Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--limit N` | Download at most N messages |
| `--after YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages after this date |
| `--before YYYY-MM-DD` | Only messages before this date |
| `--noresume` | Start fresh instead of resuming |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed progress |

### Incremental Sync

After the initial full sync, use incremental sync for efficient updates. It uses the Gmail History API to fetch only new and changed messages:

```bash
msgvault sync you@gmail.com

# Or sync all accounts at once
msgvault sync
```

### Resumable Checkpoints

If a sync is interrupted (network error, Ctrl+C), run the same command again. It resumes from the last checkpoint:

```bash
# This resumes automatically
msgvault sync-full you@gmail.com --after 2024-01-01 --before 2024-02-01
```

Checkpoint data is stored in the `sync_checkpoints` table. Use `--noresume` to discard checkpoints and start over.

### Rate Limiting

msgvault uses token bucket rate limiting to respect Gmail API quotas. The default is 5 requests per second, configurable in `config.toml`:

```toml
[sync]
rate_limit_qps = 5
```

Reduce this value if you encounter rate limit errors during large syncs.

### Safety

Sync operations are **read-only**. They use only `messages.list` and `messages.get` Gmail APIs. No write operations are performed. Your Gmail data remains untouched.
